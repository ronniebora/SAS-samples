PROC RANK 
;

In SAS, there are multiple ways to calculate rank overall or by a grouping variable. In data step, it can be done via retain statement. SAS made it easy to compute rank with PROC RANK.;

data tmp_cr;
set sashelp.cars;
run;

Notes :  
    The OUT option is used to store output of the rank procedure.
    The VAR option is used to specify numeric variable (s) for which you want to calculate rank
    The RANKS option tells SAS to name the rank variable
    By default, it calculates rank in ascending order.
	Percentiles - groups option in PROC RANK.
	Ranking within GRoup - by statement in proc rank.
;
1. Ranking by a continuous variable;
proc rank data= tmp_cr out = tmp_cr1;
    var msrp;
    ranks ranking;
    run;

2. Ranking by a continuous variable in reverse order;
proc rank data = tmp_cr descending out = tmp_cr1;
var invoice;
ranks ranking;
run;

3. Percentile Rank ;



proc rank data = tmp_cr descending groups = 4 out = tmp_cr1;
var invoice ;
ranks ranking ;
run;

4. Ranked by Group 
proc sort data = tmp_cr;
by invoice;
run;

proc rank data = tmp_cr groups=10 out = tmp_cr1;
var invoice;
ranks ranking;
by Type;
run;

5. Breaking Ties. DENSE Rank;

     proc rank data= tmp_cr ties = dense out = tmp_cr2;
    var invoice;
    ranks rank_dense;
    run;

    LOW - assigns the smallest of the corresponding ranks.
    HIGH - assigns the largest of the corresponding ranks.
    MEAN - assigns the mean of the corresponding ranks (Default Option).
    DENSE - assigns the smallest of the corresponding rank and add +1 to the next rank (don't break sequence)
