Subsetting Datasets

Sub setting a SAS data set means extracting a part of the data set by selecting a fewer number of variables or fewer number of observations or both.
sub setting of variables is done by using KEEP and DROP statement
sub setting of observations is done using DELETE statement

resulting data from the sub setting operation is held in a new data set which can be used for further analysis. Sub setting is mainly used for the purpose of analyzing a part of the data set without using those variables or observations which may not be relevant to the analysis.


Sub seting Variables

DATA Employee; 
  INPUT empid ename $ salary DEPT $ ; 
DATALINES; 
1 Rick 623.3 	IT 		 
2 Dan 515.2 	OPS	
3 Mike 611.5 	IT 	
4 Ryan 729.1    HR 
5 Gary 843.25   FIN 
6 Tusar 578.6   IT 
7 Pranab 632.8  OPS
8 Rasmi 722.5   FIN 
;
RUN;
DATA OnlyDept;
 SET Employee;
 DROP empid salary;
  RUN;
 PROC PRINT DATA=OnlyDept; 
RUN; 


DATA OnlyDept;
 SET Employee;
 KEEP ename DEPT;
  RUN;
 PROC PRINT DATA=OnlyDept; 
RUN; 



Sub setting Observations

In this method we extract only few observations from the entire data set.

Syntax

We use PROC FREQ which keeps track of the observations selected for the new data set.

The syntax for sub setting observations is:
  IF Var Condition THEN DELETE ;

DATA Employee; 
  INPUT empid name $ salary DEPT $ ; 
DATALINES; 
1 Rick 623.3	IT 		 
2 Dan 515.2 	OPS	
3 Mike 611.5 	IT 	
4 Ryan 729.1    HR 
5 Gary 843.25   FIN 
6 Tusar 578.6   IT 
7 Pranab 632.8  OPS
8 Rasmi 722.5   FIN 
;
RUN;
DATA OnlyDept;
 SET Employee;
 IF salary < 700 THEN DELETE;
  RUN;
 PROC PRINT DATA=OnlyDept; 
RUN;
