WHERE = Data Set Option

1. In the example shown below, the WHERE= data set option is used to select only section A data.

 data readin1 (where = (section ='A'));
set readin;
run;

 2. The following example shows how to use WHERE= data set option in procedures 
proc print data=readin (where=(section='A'));
run;

 In this case, you can also use WHERE statement....
proc print data=readin;
where section='A';
run;


/*
WHERE condition wins against IF condition in the following cases :

1. The WHERE statement can be used in procedures to subset data while IF statement cannot be used in procedures.
2. WHERE can be used as a data set option while IF cannot be used as a data set option.
3. The WHERE statement is more efficient than IF statement. It tells SAS not to read all observations from the data set.
4. The WHERE statement can be used to search for all similar character values that sound alike while IF statement cannot be used.

IF condition wins against WHERE condition in the following cases :

 1. When reading data using INPUT statement.
2. When it is required to execute multiple conditional statements
This can be easily done using IF-THEN-ELSE IF statements. However, WHERE statement requires variables to exist in the data set.
3. When it is required to use newly created variables in data set.
IF statement can be applied on a newly created variable whereas WHERE statement cannot be applied on a newly created variable. In the below example, IF statement doesn't require variables to exist in the READIN data set while WHERE statement requires variable to exist in the data set.
4. When to Use _N_, FIRST., LAST. Variables
WHERE statement cannot be applied on automatic variables such as _N_, First., Last. Variables. While IF statement can be applied on automatic variables.
