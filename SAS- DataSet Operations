/*  Creating and Modifying Variables*/

I. Creating a numeric variable
 You create variables using the form:  variable = expression;
 Suppose you are asked to create two new variables, OldPrice and NewPrice, in the existing SAS data set Example1. Both variables are numeric. The value of OldPrice is 10 units and NewPrice twice of OldPrice;

DATA Readin;
SET Example1;
OldPrice=10;
NewPrice=OldPrice*2;
proc print noobs;
RUN;


II. Creating a character variable
 In the same dataset Example1, lets create a character variable say Type. The character value for set is set 'Good';
DATA Readin;
SET Example1;
Type = 'Good';
proc print noobs;
RUN;

III. Creating or Modifying a variable
 Suppose the value of OldPrice is increased by 5 units and you need to calculate the relative change in price.;
DATA Readin;
SET Example1;
Oldprice = 10;
OldPrice=5 + OldPrice;
NewPrice=OldPrice*2;
Change= (NewPrice-OldPrice)/ OldPrice;
proc print noobs; RUN;

 2. The following example shows how to use WHERE= data set option in procedures 
proc print data=readin (where=(section='A'));
run;

 In this case, you can also use WHERE statement....
proc print data=readin;
where section='A';

/*
WHERE condition wins against IF condition in the following cases :

1. The WHERE statement can be used in procedures to subset data while IF statement cannot be used in procedures.
2. WHERE can be used as a data set option while IF cannot be used as a data set option.
3. The WHERE statement is more efficient than IF statement. It tells SAS not to read all observations from the data set.
4. The WHERE statement can be used to search for all similar character values that sound alike while IF statement cannot be used.

IF condition wins against WHERE condition in the following cases :

 1. When reading data using INPUT statement.
2. When it is required to execute multiple conditional statements
This can be easily done using IF-THEN-ELSE IF statements. However, WHERE statement requires variables to exist in the data set.
3. When it is required to use newly created variables in data set.
IF statement can be applied on a newly created variable whereas WHERE statement cannot be applied on a newly created variable. In the below example, IF statement doesn't require variables to exist in the READIN data set while WHERE statement requires variable to exist in the data set.
4. When to Use _N_, FIRST., LAST. Variables
WHERE statement cannot be applied on automatic variables such as _N_, First., Last. Variables. While IF statement can be applied on automatic variables.

Subsetting Datasets

Sub setting a SAS data set means extracting a part of the data set by selecting a fewer number of variables or fewer number of observations or both.
sub setting of variables is done by using KEEP and DROP statement
sub setting of observations is done using DELETE statement

resulting data from the sub setting operation is held in a new data set which can be used for further analysis. Sub setting is mainly used for the purpose of analyzing a part of the data set without using those variables or observations which may not be relevant to the analysis.

Sub setting Observations

In this method we extract only few observations from the entire data set.

Syntax

We use PROC FREQ which keeps track of the observations selected for the new data set.

The syntax for sub setting observations is:
  IF Var Condition THEN DELETE ;
