In PROC SORT, there are two options by which we can remove duplicates.

1. NODUPKEY Option               2. NODUP Option
The NODUPKEY option removes duplicate observations where value of a variable listed in BY statement is repeated while NODUP option removes duplicate observations where values in all the variables are repeated (identical observations).
;
PROC SORT DATA = readin NODUPKEY;
BY ID;
RUN;

PROC SORT DATA = readin NODUP;
 BY ID;
 RUN;

To sort by all the variables without having to list them all in the program, you can use the keyword ‘_ALL_’ in the BY statement (see below).


PROC SORT DATA = readin NODUP;
BY _all_;
RUN;

Use the DUPOUT= option with NODUPKEY (or NODUP) to output duplicates to the specified SAS data set: 

PROC SORT DATA = readin NODUPKEY DUPOUT= readin1;
BY ID;
RUN;
