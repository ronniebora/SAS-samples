PROC FREQ

The PROC FREQ is one of the most frequently used SAS procedures which helps to summarize categorical variable. 
It calculates count/frequency and cumulative frequency of categories of a categorical variable. In other words, it returns the number and percentage of cases falling in multiple categories of a categorical variable. Its not just restricted to counts. 
Produces bar charts and tests for association between two categorical variables. Categorical variables are of two types - Nominal and Ordinal. A nominal variable is a categorical variable in which categories do not have any order. For example, gender, city etc. An ordinal categorical variable has categories that can be ordered in a meaningful way. For example, rank, status (high/medium/low) etc.

data tmp_cr;
set sashelp.cars;
run;


proc freq data = tmp_cr;
tables Make ;
run;

TABLES statements tells SAS to return n-way frequency and crosstabulation tables and computes the statistics for these tables.

proc freq data = tmp_cr;
tables Make/ nocum ;
run;

# cross tabulation with multiple categorical variable
--all stats default;
proc freq data = tmp_cr;
tables Make * Cylinders;
run;
--only freq like an excel pivot;
proc freq data = tmp_cr;
tables Make * Cylinders / norow nocol nopercent;
run;
--all statistics in a list form instead of cross table;
proc freq data = tmp_cr;
tables Make * Cylinders / list;
run;
--multiple tables pivots for each category;
proc freq data = tmp_cr;
tables Make*( DriveTrain Cylinders )/ norow nocol nopercent;
run;
-- count of distinct values ;
proc freq data = tmp_cr NLEVELS;
tables Make;
run;
--when data already have counts (assuming that cylinder is a count at pivotal level );
proc freq data = tmp_cr;
tables Make*DriveTrain;
weight Cylinders;run;

Chi-Square Analysis
The CHISQ option provides chi-square tests of homogeneity or independence and measures of association between two categorical variables.
 identify the statistically significant categorical variables that we should include in our predictive model. All the categorical variables with a chi-square value less than or equal to 0.05 are kept.

proc freq data = tmp_cr noprint;
tables Make * DriveTrain / chisq;
output All out=temp_chi chisq;
run; 

Generate Bar Chart and Dot Plot
To produce a bar chart for variable 'y', the plots=freqplot (type=bar) option is added. 
By default, it shows frequency in graph. In order to show percent, you need to add scale=percent. 
The ODS graphics ON statement tells SAS to produce graphs. Later we turn it off.;

Ods graphics on;
Proc freq data=tmp_cr order=freq;
    Tables Make / plots=freqplot (type=bar scale=percent);
    Run;
Ods graphics off;

Ods graphics on;
Proc freq data=tmp_cr order=freq;
    Tables Cylinder / plots=freqplot (type=bar);
    Run;
Ods graphics off;


Ods graphics on;
Proc freq data=tmp_cr order=freq;
    Tables DriveTrain / plots=freqplot (type=dot);
    Run;
Ods graphics off;

Ods graphics on;
Proc freq data=tmp_cr order=freq;
    Tables Wheelbase / plots=freqplot (type=dot);
    Run;
Ods graphics off;

** To sort categories on descending order by frequency (from largest to smallest count), add ORDER=FREQ option
** To order categories based on a particular FORMAT, you can use order = FORMATTED option.
